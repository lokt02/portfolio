    description:"This is a research project that I was doing at my first year at University. I used Microsoft SEAL library to investigate how effective homomorphic encryption in cloud evaluations. I developed program that builds function graph but evaluating of function value happens on server. Before sending value to server it homomorphicly encrypts.",
